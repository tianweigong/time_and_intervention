### Statistical Analysis

* `analysis_exp1.Rmd`, `analysis_exp2.Rmd` ---  analysis code for Experment 1 and 2
* `exp1.Rda`, `exp2.Rda`,  `exp1_final.Rda`, `exp2_final.Rda` --- data (the `_final` version excluded the outlier participants)
* `exp1_nor`, `exp2_nor` --- IO performance on stimuli generated by each participant
* `fun_sim_gen.R`, `sim_locEveSim.R`, `df.locevesim.Rda`---  for the analysis of whether the intervention intervals were correlated with characteristic peak event density of each structure
* `DBN.Rdata`, `per_setting.Rda` --- information of causal structures
* `blcoking_code.R` --- rules for coding the blocking interventions



### Visualization 

* `fig_complex.R` ---  several figures for comlexity analysis in Results
* `fig_example.R` ---  several figures to demostrate models in the paper
* `fig_node_exp1.R`, `fig_node_exp2.R` ---  two figures showing how people perform in different structures



### Model Fitting

* `soft_max_exp1.R`, `soft_max_exp2.R`, `fun_softmax.R` --- fitting participants' interventions under softmax fuctions
* `report_exp1.R`,  `report_exp2.R` --- summaring the fitting results
* `exp1_eig`, `exp2_eig` --- EIG and ECC predictions for every second
* `md_all_exp1.R`, `md_all_exp2.R` --- summaried datasets of EIG and ECC predictions
* `mdall.Rda`, `mdall_exp2.Rda` --- output of `md_all_exp1.R`, `md_all_exp2.R` 



### Modeling

(*Many large files will be generated midway through, so the code here is mainly for checking not implementing)

In `modeling/inference` 

* ` fun_infer_nor.R` --- IO model
* `task_nor_exp1.R`, `task_nor_exp2.R` --- running the IO models to generate files under `exp1_nor`, `exp2_nor`
* `per_setting`, `per_setting_exp1.R`, `per_setting_exp2.R` --- basic parameter setting

In `modeling/intervention`

* `fun_eig.R` --- EIG and ECC models
* `task_exp1.R`, `task_exp2.R` --- running the models
* `per_setting` --- basic parameter setting
* `sim_str.R`, `sim_combine.R` , `act_transfer.R`, `expd_blc_var.R` --- pre-simulated common patterns to speed up the model calculations
