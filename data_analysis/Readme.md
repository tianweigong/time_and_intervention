### Statistical Analysis

* `analysis_exp1.Rmd`, `analysis_exp2.Rmd` ---  analysis code for Experment 1 and 2
* `analysis_comb.Rmd`--- analysis code for comparing Experiment 1 and 2
*  `exp1_final.Rda`, `exp2_final.Rda` , `exp1_forComb.Rda`, `exp2_forComb.Rda` --- data (the `_final` version has excluded the outlier participants, the `_forComb` version included variables that generated in pre-processing).
* `exp1_nor`, `exp2_nor` --- IO performance on stimuli generated by each participant
* `DBN.Rdata`, `per_setting.Rda` --- information of causal structures
* `blcoking_code.R` --- rules for coding the blocking interventions

(visualization)

* `fig_complex.R` ---  several figures for comlexity analysis in Results
* `fig_example.R` ---  several figures to demostrate models in the paper
* `fig_node_exp1.R`, `fig_node_exp2.R` ---  two figures showing how people perform in different structures



### Simulation

(*Some prerequisite large files are not included, so the code related to data generation is mainly for checking not implementing)

`sim_random.Rmd` --- simulate the random interventions and plot the figure in the main result sessions

`sim_learners.Rmd` --- simulate the resource rational learners and plot the figures in the appendix

`sim_random`--- results from `sim_random.Rmd`

`sim_learner`,`sim_learner2`,`sim_learner_re` -- results from `sim_learners.Rmd` for Experiment 1 and 2 separately, and noisy-IO results in both Experiments.

`fun_sim_gen.R`, `fun_infer_nor.R`,`fun_eig.R`, --- relevant functions



### Model Fitting

* `softmax_jud.R`, `softmax_jud_exp2.R` --- the only files about noisy-IO causal judgment fitting. Other files are about intervention fitting.
* `soft_max_exp1.R`, `soft_max_exp2.R`, `fun_softmax.R` --- fitting participants' interventions under softmax fuctions
* `softmax`, `softmax2` --- model fitting result files
* `report_exp1.R`,  `report_exp2.R` --- summaring the intervention fitting results
* `exp1_eig`, `exp2_eig` --- EIG and ECC predictions for every second
* `md_all_exp1.R`, `md_all_exp2.R` --- summaried datasets of EIG and ECC predictions
* `mdall.Rda`, `mdall_exp2.Rda` --- output of `md_all_exp1.R`, `md_all_exp2.R` 

* `_retro`, `_act`, `_wd`, some speficial files for further fitting results, such as retrospective vs. prospective differences, excluding the windows that had no actions, window-sensitivity check (in the appendix).

  



### Modeling

(*Many large files will be generated midway through, so the code here is mainly for checking not implementing)

In `modeling/inference` 

* ` fun_infer_nor.R` --- IO model
* `task_nor_exp1.R`, `task_nor_exp2.R` --- running the IO models to generate files under `exp1_nor`, `exp2_nor`
* `per_setting`, `per_setting_exp1.R`, `per_setting_exp2.R` --- basic parameter setting

In `modeling/intervention`

* `fun_eig.R` --- EIG and ECC models
* `task_exp1.R`, `task_exp2.R` --- running the models
* `per_setting` --- basic parameter setting
* `sim_str.R`, `sim_combine.R` , `act_transfer.R`, `expd_blc_var.R` --- pre-simulated common patterns to speed up the model calculations
